Following file contains implementation of signing and verifying using Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).
The algorithm uses a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The private key is used to
generate a digital signature for a message, and such a signature can be verified by using the signer's
corresponding public key. The digital signature provides message authentication (the receiver can verify
the origin of the message), integrity (the receiver can verify that the message has not been modified
since it was signed) and non-repudiation (the sender cannot falsely claim that they have not signed
the message).
